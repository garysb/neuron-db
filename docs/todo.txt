With joint comprehentions, we need to come up with rules.
For instance if we use:
	get links links [2] <-- This should return the links of 2's links
but the problem is for instance:
	remove links [2] <-- Should this remove 2's links or remove the nodes that 2 links to?

Build a range of interfaces and provide the ability to use them. Here are are
list of interfaces we might want:
* sort							(Let users order/sort their linked nodes)
* stats							(Generate statistics for linked nodes)
*range							(Get nodes within a range. eg. by creation date or value)
** group						(when node called through group link, return all the links data within a link type)

Need to implement security model.
This will work by creating our root node (node 1) as our base security node.
All users are then members (linked) to our root node. When a node is
created, it inherits the security link from the user by default. By doing this, we
can create any combination of security model on a node basis that we want. eg.
we can create a group node, and assign the node to the group. (a group node would
just be a node with links to users). We can assign any kind of information we want
to users simply by attaching nodes to the user (say: dob, address, expiry,...).

Need to implement variables
For variables we need three different levels of variables. Level 1 should be set
to the client connection. This will let people define tempory variables for each
session as a simple place marker.
Level 2 should be attached to the user. This means that a user can define variables
to be used in the future. These will be attached to the users node, and will contain
a node id to reference by the name.
Level 3 should be a global variable that can be shared. To impliment this, we should
probably use the standard level 2, but attach it higher up the security chain. This
will let us assign variables to groups, users, nodes, ...
